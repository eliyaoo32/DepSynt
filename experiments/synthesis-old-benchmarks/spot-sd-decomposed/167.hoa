trying to create strategy directly for (r_0 R !g_0) & (r_1 R !g_1) & G((!g_0 | !g_1) & ((g_0 & G!r_0) -> F!g_0) & ((g_0 & X(!g_0 & !r_0)) -> X(r_0 R !g_0)) & ((g_1 & G!r_1) -> F!g_1) & ((g_1 & X(!g_1 & !r_1)) -> X(r_1 R !g_1)) & ((r_0 & Xr_1) -> XX(g_0 & g_1))) & G(r_0 -> Fg_0) & G(r_1 -> Fg_1)
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
