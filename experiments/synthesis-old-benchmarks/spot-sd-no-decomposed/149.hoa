trying to create strategy directly for (!decide & GFhready & !FGbusreq & G(!ready1 -> X!decide)) -> (ready1 & G((decide -> XX((!(incr & locked) -> ready1) & ((incr & locked) -> ((!ready1 U (!busreq & hready)) | G!ready1)))) & ((ready1 & X!decide) -> Xready1) & ((ready1 & Xdecide) -> X(!ready1 & X!ready1))))
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
