trying to create strategy directly for G(!((!u0a0a & u0a0f1dval241b) <-> (u0a0a & !u0a0f1dval241b)) & !((!u0b0b & u0b0f1dval251b) <-> (u0b0b & !u0b0f1dval251b)) & !((!u0c0c & u0c0f1dval31b) <-> (u0c0c & !u0c0f1dval31b))) & ((G((u0a0f1dval241b & u0b0f1dval251b) -> Xp0b0in24) & G(u0c0f1dval31b -> Xp0b0in25)) -> (GFp0b0in24 & GFp0b0in25 & G!(p0b0in24 & p0b0in25)))
