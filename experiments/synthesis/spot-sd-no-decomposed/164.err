trying to create strategy directly for G((G!allfinished -> (G!finished_0 | G!finished_1 | G!finished_2)) & (allfinished -> X(G!allfinished | (!allfinished U finished_0))) & (allfinished -> X(G!allfinished | (!allfinished U finished_1))) & (allfinished -> X(G!allfinished | (!allfinished U finished_2))))
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
