trying to create strategy directly for (!b_0 & !b_1) -> (!f_0 & ((G(((b_0 & !(!f_0 & open)) -> Xb_0) & ((b_1 & !(f_0 & open)) -> Xb_1) & ((b_0 & !f_0 & open) -> X!b_0) & ((b_1 & f_0 & open) -> X!b_1)) & GF!obstacle) -> (G(!(down & up) & (open -> (!down & !up)) & ((!f_0 & up) -> b_1) & ((down & f_0) -> (b_0 | (!b_0 & !b_1))) & ((!f_0 & open) -> b_0) & ((f_0 & open) -> b_1) & (up <-> (!f_0 & Xf_0)) & (down <-> (f_0 & X!f_0)) & ((obstacle & open) -> Xopen) & (!f_0 -> X(f_0 | !f_0)) & (f_0 -> X(f_0 | !f_0))) & GF(b_0 -> (!f_0 & open)) & GF(b_1 -> (f_0 & open)) & !FG(!b_0 & !b_1 & f_0))))
