trying to create strategy directly for G(!((u0out0f1db1b & !u0out0out) <-> (!u0out0f1db1b & u0out0out)) & !((u0out250f1dfun0p1db0a1b1b & !u0out250out25) <-> (!u0out250f1dfun0p1db0a1b1b & u0out250out25))) & ((GFp0b0a & G!(p0b0a & p0b0c)) -> (G(u0out0f1db1b U p0b0a) & G(p0b0c <-> u0out250f1dfun0p1db0a1b1b)))
