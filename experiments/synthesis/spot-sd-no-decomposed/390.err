trying to create strategy directly for G(!((!u0d0d & u0d0f1dfun0p1db0in251b1b) <-> (u0d0d & !u0d0f1dfun0p1db0in251b1b)) & !((!u0e0e & u0e0f1dfun0p1db0in31b1b) <-> (u0e0e & !u0e0f1dfun0p1db0in31b1b))) & G((p0b0in3 & p0b0in25) -> (u0d0f1dfun0p1db0in251b1b | u0e0e)) & G(u0e0f1dfun0p1db0in31b1b <-> (p0b0in4 | p0b0in25))
