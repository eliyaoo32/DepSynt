trying to create strategy directly for G((allfinished -> X((!allfinished U finished_0) | G!allfinished)) & (allfinished -> X(G!allfinished | (!allfinished U finished_1))) & (allfinished -> X(G!allfinished | (!allfinished U finished_2)))) & (GFallfinished <-> (GFfinished_0 & GFfinished_1 & GFfinished_2))
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
