trying to create strategy directly for (((!all_finished U finished_0) | G!all_finished) & (G!all_finished | (!all_finished U finished_1)) & (G!all_finished | (!all_finished U finished_2))) -> G((Fall_finished -> (Ffinished_0 & Ffinished_1 & Ffinished_2)) & (all_finished -> X((!all_finished U finished_0) | G!all_finished)) & (all_finished -> X(G!all_finished | (!all_finished U finished_1))) & (all_finished -> X(G!all_finished | (!all_finished U finished_2))))
