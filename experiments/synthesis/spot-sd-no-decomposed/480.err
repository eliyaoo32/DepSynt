trying to create strategy directly for G(((!g_0 & r_0) -> Xr_0) & ((g_0 & !r_0) -> X!r_0) & F!(g_0 & r_0) & ((!g_1 & r_1) -> Xr_1) & ((g_1 & !r_1) -> X!r_1) & F!(g_1 & r_1)) -> (G((!g_0 | !g_1) & ((r_0 & Xr_1) -> F(g_0 & g_1))) & G(r_0 -> Fg_0) & G(r_1 -> Fg_1))
srun: error: cn11: task 0: Exited with exit code 1
