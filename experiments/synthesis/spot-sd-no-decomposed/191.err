trying to create strategy directly for (!r2b_ack0 & G(!b2r_req0 -> X!r2b_ack0) & G(b2r_req0 -> XFr2b_ack0)) -> (!b2r_req0 & G((!b2r_req0 | !b2r_req1) & (r2b_ack0 -> X!b2r_req0) & ((b2r_req0 & !r2b_ack0) -> Xb2r_req0) & ((b2r_req0 & X!b2r_req0) -> X(!b2r_req0 U (!b2r_req0 & b2r_req1))) & ((s2b_req0 | s2b_req1) -> XF(b2r_req0 | b2r_req1))))
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
