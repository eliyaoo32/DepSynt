trying to create strategy directly for G(((!hburst_0 & !hburst_1) -> single) & ((hburst_0 & !hburst_1) -> burst4) & ((!hburst_0 & hburst_1) -> incr) & !(single & (burst4 | incr)) & !(burst4 & incr))
direct strategy was found.
direct strat has 1 states, 1 edges and 0 colors
simplification took 0.000107161 seconds
AIG circuit was created in 0.000100218 seconds and has 0 latches and 2 gates
