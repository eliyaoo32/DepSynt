trying to create strategy directly for G(((!request_0 & !request_1 & !request_2) -> F(!grant_0 & !grant_1 & !grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((request_0 & !request_1 & !request_2) -> F(grant_0 & !grant_1 & !grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((!request_0 & request_1 & !request_2) -> F(!grant_0 & grant_1 & !grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((request_0 & request_1 & !request_2) -> F(grant_0 & grant_1 & !grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((!request_0 & !request_1 & request_2) -> F(!grant_0 & !grant_1 & grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((request_0 & !request_1 & request_2) -> F(grant_0 & !grant_1 & grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((!request_0 & request_1 & request_2) -> F(!grant_0 & grant_1 & grant_2 & !grant_3)) & ((request_0 & request_1 & request_2) -> F(grant_0 & grant_1 & grant_2 & !grant_3))) & GF((grant_0 <-> Xgrant_0) & (grant_1 <-> Xgrant_1) & (grant_2 <-> Xgrant_2))
