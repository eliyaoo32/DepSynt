trying to create strategy directly for G(!((u0sitting2arrganent0f1dgenerate0calendar1b & !u0sitting2arrganent0sitting2arrganent) <-> (!u0sitting2arrganent0f1dgenerate0calendar1b & u0sitting2arrganent0sitting2arrganent)) & !((u0sitting2arragment0f1dsitting02arragment1b & !u0sitting2arragment0sitting2arragment) <-> (!u0sitting2arragment0f1dsitting02arragment1b & u0sitting2arragment0sitting2arragment))) & (GFp0p0new2day0time -> G(p0p0new2day0time -> (u0sitting2arrganent0f1dgenerate0calendar1b & X(u0sitting2arragment0f1dsitting02arragment1b U p0p0new2day0time))))
