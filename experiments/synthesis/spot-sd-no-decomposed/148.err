trying to create strategy directly for (!decide & GFhready & G(!ready3 -> X!decide)) -> (ready3 & G((decide -> XX((!(locked & single) -> ready3) & ((locked & single) -> (!ready3 U (hready & !ready3 & Xready3))))) & ((ready3 & X!decide) -> Xready3) & ((ready3 & Xdecide) -> X(!ready3 & X!ready3))))
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
