trying to create strategy directly for G(!((!u0a0f1dval241b & !((u0a0a & !u0a0f1dval251b) <-> (!u0a0a & u0a0f1dval251b))) <-> (u0a0f1dval241b & !(u0a0a | u0a0f1dval251b))) & !((!u0b0f1dval241b & !((u0b0b & !u0b0f1dval251b) <-> (!u0b0b & u0b0f1dval251b))) <-> (u0b0f1dval241b & !(u0b0b | u0b0f1dval251b)))) & (G((u0a0f1dval241b & u0b0f1dval251b) -> Xp0b0in24) -> (GFp0b0in24 & GFu0a0f1dval251b & GFu0b0f1dval241b))
