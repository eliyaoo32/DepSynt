trying to create strategy directly for (!etc & G((!etc & !sts) -> X!etc) & G(etc -> F!etc) & G(sts -> Xetc)) -> G((sflr | shlr) & ((shlr & X!shlr) -> sts) & ((sflr & X!sflr) -> sts) & ((!sflr & (!ec | !etc)) -> Xsflr) & ((!shlr & (ec | !etc)) -> Xshlr) & (ec -> F!sflr) & F!shlr)
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
