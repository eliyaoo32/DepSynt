trying to create strategy directly for (G(!r1 | !r2) & G(!r1 | !r3) & G(!r1 | !r4) & G(!r2 | !r3) & G(!r2 | !r4) & G(!r3 | !r4)) -> G((!g1 | !g2) & (!g1 | !g3) & (!g1 | !g4) & (!g2 | !g3) & (!g2 | !g4) & (!g3 | !g4) & G(r1 -> (Xg1 | XXg1 | XXXg1)) & G(r2 -> (Xg2 | XXg2 | XXXg2)) & G(r3 -> (Xg3 | XXg3 | XXXg3)) & G(r4 -> (Xg4 | XXg4 | XXXg4)))
direct strategy might exist but was not found.
