trying to create strategy directly for G(!((!u0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b & !((!u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b & u0pos0pos) <-> (u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b & !u0pos0pos))) <-> (u0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b & !(u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b | u0pos0pos))) & !((!u0score0f1dzero1b & !((!u0score0f1dadd0score0f1done1b1b & u0score0score) <-> (u0score0f1dadd0score0f1done1b1b & !u0score0score))) <-> (u0score0f1dzero1b & !(u0score0f1dadd0score0f1done1b1b | u0score0score))) & !((!u0vel0f1done1b & !((!u0vel0f1dadd0vel0f1done1b1b & u0vel0vel) <-> (u0vel0f1dadd0vel0f1done1b1b & !u0vel0vel))) <-> (u0vel0f1done1b & !(u0vel0f1dadd0vel0f1done1b1b | u0vel0vel)))) & ((G(u0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b -> X!p0p0left2most0pos) & G(u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b -> X!p0p0right2most0pos)) -> (G(p0p0left2most0pos -> Fu0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b) & G(p0p0right2most0pos -> Fu0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b) & G((!p0p0left2most0pos & !p0p0right2most0pos) -> F(u0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b | u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b)) & G(p0p0left2most0pos -> ((!u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b U p0p0right2most0pos) | G!u0pos0f1dsub0pos0vel1b)) & G(p0p0right2most0pos -> ((!u0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b U p0p0left2most0pos) | G!u0pos0f1dadd0pos0vel1b)) & G((u0score0f1dadd0score0f1done1b1b & u0vel0f1dadd0vel0f1done1b1b) <-> (p0p0center0pos & p0p0clicked0button)) & G((u0score0f1dzero1b & u0vel0f1done1b) <-> (!p0p0center0pos & p0p0clicked0button))))
