trying to create strategy directly for (x0 & !x1 & !x2 & !x3 & G(X(x0 | x1 | x2 | x3) -> (!y1 & !y2)) & G((x0 | x1 | x2 | x3) -> X(!x0 & !x1 & !x2 & !x3)) & XG!(x0 & !x1 & !x2 & !x3)) -> (G(X(y0 | y1 | y2) -> (x0 | x1 | x2 | x3 | y0 | y1 | y2)) & G((y0 | y1 | y2) -> (!x0 & !x1 & !x2 & !x3)) & G((x0 | x1 | x2 | x3) -> X(y0 | y1 | y2)) & G((y0 | y1 | y2) -> (!(!y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (y0 & !y1 & !y2))) & G((y0 & !y1 & !y2) -> X(!y0 & !y1 & !y2)) & G((!x0 & !x1 & !x2 & x3) -> (!(y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (!y0 & y1 & !y2))) & G((!x0 & !x1 & !x2 & x3) -> (!(y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (y0 & y1 & !y2))) & G((!x0 & x1 & !x2 & !x3) -> (!(y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (!y0 & !y1 & y2))) & G((!x0 & x1 & !x2 & !x3) -> (!(y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (y0 & !y1 & y2))) & ((x0 & !x1 & !x2 & !x3) -> (!(y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (!y0 & y1 & !y2))) & ((x0 & !x1 & !x2 & !x3) -> (!(y0 & !y1 & !y2) U (y0 & y1 & !y2))))
