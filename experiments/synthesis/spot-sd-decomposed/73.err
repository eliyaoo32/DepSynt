trying to create strategy directly for G(!((!u0accel0f1ddeaccel1b & !((u0accel0accel & !u0accel0f1dspeed2up1b) <-> (!u0accel0accel & u0accel0f1dspeed2up1b))) <-> (u0accel0f1ddeaccel1b & !(u0accel0accel | u0accel0f1dspeed2up1b))) & !((!u0brakes0f1dhit2brakes1b & !((u0brakes0brakes & !u0brakes0f1doff2brakes1b) <-> (!u0brakes0brakes & u0brakes0f1doff2brakes1b))) <-> (u0brakes0f1dhit2brakes1b & !(u0brakes0brakes | u0brakes0f1doff2brakes1b)))) & G(((u0accel0f1ddeaccel1b & u0brakes0f1dhit2brakes1b) U (p0p0clear2ahead0track | p0p0slow0speed)) | G(u0accel0f1ddeaccel1b & u0brakes0f1dhit2brakes1b)) & G(p0p0clear2ahead0track -> (u0accel0f1dspeed2up1b & u0brakes0f1doff2brakes1b))
