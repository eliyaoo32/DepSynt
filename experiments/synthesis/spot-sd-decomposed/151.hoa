there are 1 subformulas
trying to create strategy directly for G(((!hburst_0 & !hburst_1) -> single) & ((hburst_0 & !hburst_1) -> burst4) & ((!hburst_0 & hburst_1) -> incr) & !(single & (burst4 | incr)) & !(burst4 & incr))
direct strategy was found.
direct strat has 1 states, 1 edges and 0 colors
simplification took 4.6082e-05 seconds
